# 19_performance_counters.s: the cycle equation, counted by the hardware itself
#
# docs/MATH.md proves that every cycle is either an instruction or one of six
# kinds of bubble:  cycles = N + 5 + L + 3F + R + K + I + D.
# Sixfold counts each term in hardware (src/Control_Status_Register_File.sv):
#
#   hpmcounter3 (0xC03)  L  load-stall cycles        hpmcounter6 (0xC06)  K  multiply/divide busy cycles
#   hpmcounter4 (0xC04)  F  flushes (3 bubbles each)  hpmcounter7 (0xC07)  I  instruction-cache miss cycles
#   hpmcounter5 (0xC05)  R  FETCH2 redirects          hpmcounter8 (0xC08)  D  data-cache miss cycles
#
# The workload below has a bit of everything (loads used right away, branches
# that are hard to guess, a multiply, a divide, cold caches). Afterwards, all
# counted since reset:
#   a0 = cycles          a1 = instructions retired (N)
#   a2 = L   a3 = F   a4 = R   a5 = K   a6 = I   a7 = D
#   s2 = N + 5 + L + 3F + R + K + I + D   (the equation, from the counters)
# s2 comes out a few cycles away from a0 only because the counters are read in
# EXECUTE while instructions and bubbles are still in flight (see 12_measure_cpi).
# Every value is checked cycle-exact against the model by `make test`.
# EXPECT: s3 = 1
